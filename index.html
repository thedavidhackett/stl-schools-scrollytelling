          <h1>The Death of the Neighborhood School</h1>
          <p>
            In 2001 three charter schools opened their doors for the first time
            in Saint Louis. Not long after then Mayor Francis Slay put out an
            open call to all organizations who were willing to start a charter
            school in Saint Louis. Now twenty years later the educational
            landscape is dominated by charter schools. The victim of their
            success? Neighborhood Schools.

                In 2000, one year before the first three charter school opened,
                there were 71 neighborhood schools servicing nearly 30,000
                students. Roughly two thirds of the students attending public
                schools in Saint Louis went to their local neighborhood school.

                By 2007 a few more charters had popped up and enrollment was on
                the rise. Encouraged by the popularity of the movement Francis
                Slay wrote to over 70 organizations inviting them to apply for
                charters in Saint Louis. Many answered the call.

                In 2013 charters faced one of their first setbacks in Saint
                Louis. The Imagine Charter School System, which had 4 schools
                serving all grades, was shut down due to performance issues.
                Saint Louis Public Schools had to find new schools for the
                influx of students.

                There are now 37 Charter schools enrolling more than 11,000
                students, representing over a third of public school students in
                Saint Louis. Meanwhile at the end of 2020 there were 38
                neighborhood schools with just over 8,000 students enrolled,
                less than a third of the students that attended neighborhood
                schools at the turn of the century.

        At the end of the 2020 school year Saint Louis Public Schools announced
        yet another round of school closings. This time eight schools would be
        shuddered, six of them neighborhood schools, including Dunbar
        Elementary, which closed in spite of a community push to keep it open.
        In the meantime SLPS moved their newest magnet school to a bigger
        building so it could better meet the demand for seats and several new
        charter schools are vying to open within the district. In Saint Louis
        it's clear that the makeup of public education is changing: neighborhood
        schools are dying out and school choice is the new norm.
